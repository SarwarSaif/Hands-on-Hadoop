# Hands-on-Hadoop

## What is Hadoop?
"An open source software platform for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware" - Hortonworks

## Hadoop History 
- Google published GFS and MapReduce papers in 2003-2004. GFS inspired Hadoop's distributed storgae system and MapReduce inspired Hadoop's distributed processing
- Yahoo! was building "Nutch", an open source web search engine at the same time.
- Hadoop was primarily driven by Doug Cutting and Tom White in 2006. 
- Hadoop was named after a stuffed elephant toy of Doug cutting's kid.
- It's been evolving ever since and build a large ecosystem around it. 

## Why Hadoop?
- Now-a-days data is too big to handle through one computer as companies generate terrabytes of data per day.
- Vertical scaling doesn't cut it
  - Disk seek times
  - Hardware failures
  - Processing times
- Horizontal scaling is linear
- Hadoop is not just for batch processing anymore
